                "Zack Mullins (b. 1986, Hazard, Kentucky) is a clerk at the rural Lost Creek, Kentucky Post Office, a Remotely Managed Post Office with 400 PO Boxes. Mullins is the only employee staffed at that office. His official title is Postal Support Employee, Sales and Service Distribution Associate or PSESSDA and he is a member of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). He was hired in 2019 and only worked for about 6 months until the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In this interview, Mullins speaks about the relationships he has developed with his customers, many of whom are elderly, the impact of COVID on his work and the community he serves, the importance of mail for him as a kid growing up in remote and rural Eastern Kentucky, and privatization of the Postal Service."

                "Roger Taulbee (b. 1948, Campton, Kentucky) was a rural mail carrier in the Vancleve, Kentucky, area for 56-58 years. He inherited the route from his father, who carried the mail for 50 years, initially on horseback. In this interview, Taulbee speaks of the changes in the Postal Service over time, the vehicles he used to deliver the mail, and what he knows of his father's time delivering the mail on horseback."
