Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."

                "Steve Jarmoc discusses his family's history in tobacco farming beginning with his grandfather, a Polish immigrant, and ending with his 19-year-old son. He talks about learning to farm as a child: planting, fixing the skips, planting, fertilize (\"side dressing\"), picking off buds (\"topping\"), \"standing tobacco up\" after storms, lighting fires to dry picked leaves, etc. He tells how he raised his own crop to pay for college. He explains different types of tobacco used to make cigars; how growing shade tobacco is more work, but more remunerative; buying his farm; economics and risks of tobacco farming; his history of his sheds; etc."
