                "Like books and magazines in the Library's general collections, this set of websites complements the original and historical visual material held in the Prints &amp; Photographs Division. Included are sites for photographers and cartoonists represented in P&amp;P (e.g., Kuper, Prokudin-Gorskii, Rogovin, and Telnaes). Also, websites for new digital image formats (e.g., Wrist photography, Reicholdarts cell phone photos, and Micah Wright remix posters). Other sites document new ways of displaying the visual arts through virtual galleries (e.g., Alternative Museum) and new ways of representing architectural work and the built environment (e.g., McKissack, Pritzker Prize, Vergara's Invincible Cities, and Vi&#241;oly). Major then-current event themes include views of Kurdistan and the Iraq War."

                "Kenneth Christman and Patricia Christman Bailey's father opened the R&R Liquor Store in 1948 in Nashville, Tennessee, and it has been in operation ever since. The store was built by a black architect, and Kenneth worked there for 42 years. He speaks about the detrimental affect the freeway (urban renewal) has had on their business. The siblings discuss other business challenges, including the fact that wine is being sold now in Tennessee grocery stores, and the negative impact that bulk stores and outlets are having on their business. Kenneth talks about the of impact gentrification on their business, and how they are not being included in the development that is currently underway in Nashville. Despite all the obstacles, the business is still going strong and Kenneth credits the success of the business to the steadfast commitment and support of the family."

                "Dr. Edward Davis talks about his father's role in owning the Ben Moore, a Green Book hotel in Montgomery Alabama. His father purchased seventeen properties in the neighborhood street where the Ben Moore hotel was located. Davis inherited all of the properties after his father passed and he discusses the challenges of being a property owner and his efforts to preserve the building. Davis shares a story about his dad, who chased Reverend Ralph Abernathy with a hatchet after he caught Abernathy having an affair with his wife. Dr. Martin Luther King wrote an article about the incident in Jet Magazine. Clinton's father sued Jet Magazine for 75,000 and won."

                "Dr. Pinkney spearheaded the restoration of the historic Hampton House, a Green Book hotel in Miami, Florida. The Hampton House was the premier spot for black celebrities and travelers in the 1950s and 1960s. It was frequented by luminaries such as Martin Luther King Jr.--(it was where he practiced his \"I Have a Dream\" speech)--and it also the place where Malcolm X proselytized Cassius Clay into Muhammad Ali. Enid Pinkney patronized the Hampton House when she was young, and in 2002, at the age of 70, when she saw that it had been abandoned for three decades, she felt that she had to do something to save it. The Markowitz family, who operated the Hampton House while it was listed in the Green Book, designated Pinkney as the \"Founding President and CEO of the Historic Hampton House Community Trust.\" With her guidance and perseverance, Pinkney raised nearly 10 million dollars to rehabilitate the property to make it just like it was in the 1950s. In this interview, Pinkney discusses the long, arduous preservation process and the challenges of convincing the city to invest millions of dollars in a building located in a poverty-stricken neighborhood. She also talks about the addicts and people suffering in the community and the need for compassion and jobs. Pinkney was 87 years old at the time of this interview."
