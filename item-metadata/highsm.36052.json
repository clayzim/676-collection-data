                "Juan Manuel Patraca is a custodian, activist and organizer for worker rights, and a published poet. He talks about starting his first job in Mexico as a five-year old blacksmith's apprentice, migrating to the United States, and how he has continued educating himself throughout his career. He discusses his extensive resume as an activist involved in improving the wages and working conditions of his fellow workers on both sides of the border; and his pride in writing poetry and presenting it to audiences that have included such notables as President Obama. Mr. Patraca's poem \u201cJustice for Janitors\u201d from his book 32 Biographies of Humble People is included at the end of the transcription."
