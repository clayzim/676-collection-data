He delivered Route 1 for two years and is on his fourth year of Route 2, which is a 70-mile route with approximately 600 boxes. Presar, who is bi-racial, spoke about racism and bigotry from some customers, how work with the Postal Service compares to his previous work in logistics and deliveries for private companies, encounters with wildlife, including bears, while on the route, and the importance of the Postal Service in rural communities."

                "LeAnn Carpenter (b. 1968 in Bangkok, Thailand) has been a regular rural mail carrier for 7 years out of the Morgantown, West Virginia postal annex. Prior to working as a regular carrier, she was a substitute for four years. She is the coworker of Steve Honaker, who was also interviewed for this project. Carpenter grew up in Minnesota and is a veteran of the US Army. She now drives an LLV and is on a more suburban rural route with more affluent customers. On her prior route, which was more rural, she drove her personal vehicles--Chevy S-10s. In this interview, Carpenter talks about differences in the job depending on the demographics of the community on her route, her relationship with her customers and the intimacy of the role of being a mail carrier, how her job has changed over time, and delivering mail during the COVID-19 pandemic."
