VIII, no. 5 (May 3, 1916). Has separately titled section, <May 30, 1917->: High school news. Stated frequency and actual frequency may differ. May be some irregularities in enumeration and chronology. May contain special issue called: D.A.R. Edition. This seems more likely to have been a one-time special issue than a true separate edition. Semiweekly edition carrying its own enumeration may have been included as part of this title during some periods when title was published daily from Nov. 15, 1917- . Despite presence of frequency edition statements, cannot be determined whether the semiweekly edition constituted an entirely separate publication. There may have been days when the semiweekly edition was the only paper printed for the day and intended to function also as the daily issue. Some issues with semiweekly edition statement give frequency as daily in publisher's block. Appears to have merged with: Cordele daily sentinel to form: Cordele dispatch and daily sentinel.
